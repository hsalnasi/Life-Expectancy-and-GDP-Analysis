- Represent the linear relationship between (GDP) and (LEABY) 

- line plot (Country - GDP ) (Country - LEABY)

- low GDP == low LEABY and the vice versa

- this theory will be tested with a .corr() function [ calculate the correlation between gdp and leapy ) 

[ pearson pic] 

from scipy.stats import pearsonr
corr_price_sqfeet, p
= pearsonr(housing.price, housing.sqfeet)
print(corr_price_sqfeet) #output: 0.507
